<!--
Basic Meta - Minimum expectation for all pages

title           - limit 70 chars.
description     - limit 155 chars.
keywords        - Not needed for Google's index ("http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html")
                  though perhaps still relevant to BAIDU, Naver, Yandex and other new market engines
charset         - Make sure your charset is defined at the top of your head or in HTTP headers, otherwise IE may have to restart page parsing (resulting in canceled requests). (via webpagetest.org)
